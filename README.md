# Learning Journal

*A lightweight Flask web journal*

This journal project is intended as a demonstration of basic Flask usage. It is
part of the course materials developed for the Code Fellows Python Dev
Accelerator course.

It was originally based on the [flaskr](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/tutorial/)
app for the Flask tutorial, but has evolved considerably since then.

It demonstrates simple, DB-API level database usage, authentication, adding and
viewing entries and testing--both unit and functional testing with
[pytest](http://pytest.org) and BDD testing with [lettuce](http://lettuce.it)
